Description
--------------------------------
Every year, the amount of data created in the world grows exponentially. However, for designers to build truly meaningful applications and experiences around data, it usually helps to start small and design around our own problems, interests and use cases. In short: designing around our own data. In this class, we will build our own personal datasets from the ground up: tracking and designing around a datatset of our own (or of our community's) that we'd like to better understand and bring to life.

Over 6 weeks, we'll learn how to collect our own data, store it, and make it available via RESTful APIs. We'll then design digital or physical interfaces to bring our data to life in a way that we find personally meaningful.

Students will learn techniques on how to work with existing Web APIs, how to build their own Web APIs from the ground up (with Node.js and Mongodb), how to make their data available via RESTful APIs, and will ultimately design around the collected data via digital (web, p5, etc.) and physical (connected objects) formats.

Class examples will be presented in Javascript. Javascript tutorials will be assigned as a pre-requisite for those with little to no Javascript experience.

You will have 2 main projects to complete over the course of 6 weeks:

1. **Project 1 (Midterm - Due in Week 4) - The Dashboard of You**. Collect a dataset from the ground up (in JSON) and then represent it via a dashboard medium of your choosing (Web page, P5.js, Illustration, Physical Installation, etc.). Be prepared to discuss 1) why you chose to collect this data; 2) how you collected it; and 3) what you built, how you built it, and the design choices you made along the way.

2. **Project 2 (Final - Due in Week 6) - Designing Around Your Own Data**. Choose a dataset that you want to better understand and bring to life (it could be your own or data from a community around you). Using your Node/Mongo/Express application, track that dataset over the course of at least 5-7 days. Your final project will be to 1) design a digital or physical interface that brings your data to life in a way that you find personally meaningful and 2) to make your API publicly accessible (i.e. you should provide documentation or a guide to your API).

Objectives
---------------------

By the end of the class, you should have a solid understanding of the following concepts:

- **Full-Stack Javascript** - Familiarity with both client-side and server-side Javascript.
- **Designing Data-Driven Applications**- How to design and build a 'full-stack' data application.
- **User-facing Web design & data visualization concepts** - How to design and build user-facing interfaces & visualizations that effectively communicate data.
- **Using APIs** - How to interact with and use an API from within your client application.
- **Structuring Data** - How to intelligently structure data.
- **Storing Data** - How to build systems to store your own data.
- **Building APIs** - How to build your own APIs and make the data available to client applications.

Grades
------

Grades will be determined according to the following breakdown:
- 2 Projects: 75%
    - Project 1 - 25%
    - Project 2 (Final) -  50%
- Participation and Attendance: 25%

Class Blog
----------

It is expected that everyone in the class will create and maintain a blog for their assignments.

Listserv
--------

We will use a listserv both to conduct discussions outside of class, and for any technical help questions. **Please email the listserv with all technical help questions (often, someone else will have a very similar question, or will at least find the answer informative).**

Go [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/the-api-of-you) and click "Apply for membership"

**Reminder About Technical Questions** Always email the listserv email (not me directly!). People often have similar questions, so it's helpful for everyone to see your questions: (email: the-api-of-you@googlegroups.com)


Laptops
-------

This class covers numerous Web programming topics, and as a result, we will use laptops extensively throughout class time. However, use of the computer outside of class topics (for example, chatting on Gmail, compulsively checking Facebook/Twitter, etc.) is disrespectful and repeated violations will be met with 1) requests to close your laptop and 2) requests to leave class if it becomes a persistent problem.

Also - while your classmates are presenting, it is **mandatory** to put your laptop lid down and focus all of your attention on your colleague's presentation.

Weekly Assignments
------------------

We will sometimes have small weekly assignments that build on material presented in class. It is expected that you post all assignments to your blog, and come prepared to talk about your work (and respectfully engage with your peers when they are presenting).

Attendance
----------

Attendance is mandatory. You must inform me via email if you are going to miss a class. Habitually showing up late for class or an excessive number of absences will adversely affect your grade.

Class Participation
-------------------

Class participation is a critical part of the class, and (along with attendance) makes up 25% of your final grade. We expect pro-active participation and feedback throughout class discussions and presentations.
